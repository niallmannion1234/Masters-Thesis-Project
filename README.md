## **Masters Thesis Project**

This is the R code for my thesis project, which scraped and analysed vaccine related tweets from Twitter, predicted vaccination status in children using machine learning models built in R Studio with patient survey data, visualises the results of these models/model performance comparisons, and predicted future rates of vaccinations in children using time series forecasting.

Building Machine Learning Models

Ten machine learning models were built, and compared in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. These models were complex because of the large number of independent variables in the training dataset, as shown by the artificial neural network below:
