This is the R code for my thesis project, which scraped and analysed vaccine related tweets from Twitter, predicted vaccination status in children using machine learning models built in R Studio with patient survey data, visualises the results of these models/model performance comparisons, and predicted future rates of vaccinations in children using time series forecasting.
